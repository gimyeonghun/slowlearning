This blog has been lying pretty dormant since its inception. The reason is simple: I was busy.

I nicely wrapped my exams, and then I started a Christmas casual job. I've been moving, but it doesn't mean I haven't been thinking. I just haven't had the time to record it.

For the longest time, I've been inspired to create an app. I thought I had the technical expertise to execute this year, so I took a risk and tried to build it. It was a valiant effort, but it was eating up my study time. But since the school year is over, I've been sharpening my software skills for another stab at it in 2023.

However, I've been inspired by an article, [The Simplest App that Makes Money](https://billprin.com/2022/12/07/simpest-app-that-makes-money.html), and I've decided to launch an app before school starts. Just a proof of concept idea. Also to prove to myself that I'm capable of shipping (*[glacial-self-62998](https://slowlearner.quest/glacial-self-62998/)* was proof that I could ship a website, but I've never shipped an app before! On the App Store of all places!)

I've dusted off an experimental side project and have decided to use that as my practice app. Though I'm supposed to make the **simplest** app, my pride will not make it that easy. There are enough interesting ideas and concepts that will keep me on my toes.

Any spare time available in the past week has been spent on the app, and I think I'm at a stage where I can start developing it in public.

So without further ado, I proudly announce the **Dev Log Miniseries**.
