Any app worth its salt starts off with a bunch of boxes and arrows drawn on a napkin. *XXX* is no different.

*XXX* is a book tracker and organiser. I love reading, but part of the motivation is the tracking feature in [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com). But its interface is clunky (I'm never going to download the Good Reads app) and I don't want to log into a website every time I finish reading. Also, I've been reading a lot of technical books, and I forget to add them to my library. So wouldn't it naturally be better if I could track my reading progress locally on my phone?

That was the motivation. Now we try to translate idea into something more tangible.

*Insert Screenshots*

Books have four statuses: `Currently Reading`, `Want to Read`, `Read` and `Closed` (the latter is in case the user decided to drop a book without deleting it completely). The user should also be able to organise books into different folders.

Book reading is organised by *reading sessions*. It's like workouts but for book reading. A timer will start and there is a little scratchpad for taking notes.
