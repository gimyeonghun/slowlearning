I failed. I've failed for a long time, but I wasn't sure how to phrase this. But here we go.

Indie development can be like jazz, where you can start freestyling whenever you open the code editor. Shipping as soon as possible is an exciting and daunting task. However, it's important to understand that rushing through the development process without proper planning and organisation can lead to creative blocks and setbacks.

My book reading app was one such case. Because I thought it could be shipped early, I dove into the development process headfirst without a proper allocation of tasks or time management. As a result, I hit a creative block and struggled to make progress on the app.

I also had to ask myself whether the app was something I really wanted to make. And the current iteration of the app is not something I want for myself. This could have been avoided if I had a clear roadmap or task list.

I'm pausing development on this app for now. I may come back to it later. But not right now.

In the future, I plan to incorporate a principle called "2 x 2 x 2" method. This involves dedicating 2 hours, 2 days, and 2 weeks to prototyping different app ideas to see if they are viable for the app market. This approach allows me to quickly test ideas and validate them without dedicating too much time or resources to a single idea. This will help me to quickly move on from ideas that are not viable and focus on those that show promise.

I've been working on something else in the meantime, but I want to be more methodical about its approach. Stay tuned for updates, because I do love blogging. But I'll be pausing updates on this miniseries for now.
