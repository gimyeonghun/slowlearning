I promised that I would make a regular series of this, but I've been busy coding for the past few weeks. Nonetheless, I plan to release some articles after this one.

Progress on my app is going well. From time to time, I run into roadblocks which frustrates me greatly. However, I am grateful that I am able to overcome them one by one.

I've also been working on the business side of things. I registered my Apple Developer account, created some social media accounts for the app and registered a domain name as well. For the former, I have successfully uploaded my app to Testflight. So it's a matter of actually polishing the damn thing so I can push for beta.
