        <h1>Slow Learner's Quest</h1>
        <p>The name of this blog is inspired by the book Thinking, Fast and Slow. It specifically refers to the latter system of thinking, System 2, which is more deliberate but slower.</p>
        <p>My current two muses are healthcare (specifically dentistry) and SwiftUI - a declarative user interface framework for developing apps on all Apple devices. I also enjoy art, fashion and mindfulness.</p>
        <p>You can explore my musings here. Otherwise you can subscribe for updates via email or RSS feed.
