> Many people don't know that the terms right wing and left wing refer to the sides of parliament during the French revolution. The right wing supported the monarchy. The core principle of conservatism is hierarchy. They believe some people are better than others. They fundamentally can't believe in democracy and so always work to elevate a few over others. Kings, dictators, autocrats, theocrats, racists, fascists, all work on the same vertical thinking. A long as they aren't at the bottom of the social hierarchy, they are happy and work to keep everyone else in their place. Women and minorities at the bottom, the wealthy and powerful at the top.
