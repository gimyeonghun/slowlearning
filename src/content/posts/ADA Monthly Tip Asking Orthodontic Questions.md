> The early detection of impacted canines is important to minimise future orthodontic treatment. For patients aged 7 to 11 years, all practitioners should assess the position of the unerupted permanent canines as part of the initial examination. If these teeth cannot be palpated buccally, apical to the deciduous canine, a screening OPG is recommended. The OPG can confirm the presence of these teeth as well as their position.

> The three key factors to assess regarding position are:
> - The degree of overlap of the crown of the canine over the root of the lateral incisor
> - The angulation of the canine in relation to a perpendicular line to the midline
> - The vertical height from the occlusal plane.

> In most cases, if the tooth is not palpable and is overlapping the lateral root and/or has a steep angulation, early removal of the deciduous canine can assist in normalising the eruption of the permanent canine. Space maintenance is not required for this in the upper arch. This approach also applies to the lower arch; however, space maintenance is required in the lower arch.
