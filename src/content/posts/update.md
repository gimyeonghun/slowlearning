I haven't written anything in a while, but that doesn't mean I've been neglecting my blog. Rather, I've been thinking a lot about what to write, which has resulted in nothing being published. How ironic, the desire to do more has resulted in doing nothing at all. 

Life has also been busy, which is a convenient excuse for not writing. But it's also the truth. Life has been fast-paced, which is exciting but also somewhat nerve wracking. So many things have happened in the past few weeks that I'm worried that I'll burn out. So now I'm trying to stabilise more, such as by writing more or investing in more introverted activities.

As I said, I've been brainstorming some longform topics, so if the next update takes a while, it's because I'm cooking something exciting.

Stay tuned.
