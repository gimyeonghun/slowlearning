If you really think about it, to-dos can be laid out as database rows.

Tags, lists and other metadata are further interfaces to surface those rows.

In the macOS space, the two clear winners of task managers are OmniFocus and Things. The former doesn't try to hide its database origins (have you seen that inspector view?!) while the latter is a more refined and beautiful version of Reminders.

However, I believe that a space exists between a polished interface and exposing metadata to the user. Additionally, OmniFocus and Things 3 have been released approximately 4 and 6 years ago, and I think that user needs in the information age have changed a lot since then. A tool needs to be created that adapts to the user, rather than the user having to adapt to the tools.
