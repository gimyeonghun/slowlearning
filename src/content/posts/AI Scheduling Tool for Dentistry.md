> I think an AI interface could help with the problem. Specific issues:
> - New patients: Not all adult NP need to be scheduled 1 hour with Dr and then 1 hour in hygiene which is normal protocol. We gave them a flowchart and list of questions to determine if they should be scheduled as above or for 90 minutes with the hygienist. Literally 3 questions. I have a 17yo new patient scheduled as an adult. She could have been scheduled 1 hour in hygiene.
> - We have 1 intraoral scanner for 2 docs. We have color coded the appointments that need the scanner and told them how to offset the appointment so assistants do not need the scanner at the same time. My partner and I have crown preps scheduled at the exact same time today. Twice.
> - Last week it was root canals at the same time. Also equipment needed at the same time.
> - They do not get the concept of scheduling for production. I've literally had days that my first 3 hours were $0 because they scheduled crown seats, denture appointments, surgical follow-ups.

Reading the comments, it looks like the underlying issue is lack of SOP training. However, despite a lot of training and meetings, it's understandable that it's difficult to apply protocols in the moment. Especially because receptionists will lack the understanding of why it's important to separate appointments so that equipment doesn't have to be shared.
