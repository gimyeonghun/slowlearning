> Once you allow yourself to "see it" dentistry is not difficult. Divid it up in three groups, two are infection, decay and gum disease and the third is mechanical, i.e. the bite. Examine for decay, is it through the enamel, is it large, small, how would you have it fixed in your own mouth. Second infection is gum disease, is it gingivitis, periodontitis, ALWAYS start with a cleaning or SRP. Don't make it so hard on yourself!!!
