> The Gov.uk design team published research around data entry for dates https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2013/12/05/asking-for-a-date... Ultimately they found the best experience was three text boxes, day, month and year. They also have this "pattern" for helping with implementation https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/

> (I worked on this pattern) Our guidance is to accept both names and numbers in the back end so people can enter either. In our testing, text inputs (with a numeric keyboard on mobile) is better than selects. Some people struggle with using selects, we don't see those issues in text inputs. That guidance maybe be about people not knowing the order of the inputs (DD MM YY, MM DD YY) but our pattern is clearly labeled for each input so we don't get that issue.
