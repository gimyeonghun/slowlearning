AI essay scoring systems are only seen in the context of school, and hence have negative connotations. But they can also be used to improve personal writing, which is actually a useful tool instead.

AI is useful if it is used as an accelerator, and not a replacement, for thinking. Very useful to bounce ideas, rapidly prototype and test hypotheses. 

In this framing, I encourage AI usage.
