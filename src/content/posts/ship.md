Over the weekend, I made something fun. I shared it with some friends. But I was more proud of the fact that I was able to ship something very quickly. I haven't worked on a side project in a *long* time and I haven't shipped anything in a much longer time, so being able to end the dry streak was a personal win. Things that helped along the way were:

1. reducing the feature list to keep things very basic
2. having prior experience on launching a website (this blog!!!)
3. using netlify to quickly upload and build the website

Another thing that really helped me was picking [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) as my Javascript framework. I've never used it before, but I've seen it been recommeneded quite a lot. It was really helpful to use their online examples REPL to flesh out the prototype. Because rather than having the mental overhead of "omagerd I'm making something", I could relax and just think that I was experimenting with something. So approaching the task with a playful mindset also aided in shipping the webapp.

I would like to work on more things in the future, and by recording this mindset, I can always come back and remember how shipping is not so bad after all.
