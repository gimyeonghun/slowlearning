[ChatGPT Atlas is an Anti-Web: The Browser That's Anti-Web](https://www.anildash.com//2025/10/22/atlas-anti-web-browser/). I'm always late to the party, so I haven't tried out Atlas. I will also never will because I'm pretty anti-Chrome. 

But Anil Dash gives it a good review:

- "searching" will take you a chat session, not the search engine results. Reading this made me realise how much we have taken the URL box for granted. It's become default UX behaviour to expect search results to appear. Anil searched with the keywords "taylor swift showgirl". I appreciated that search engine have become so good at recognising intent, because there are various branches to explore from there. Are you looking for informationa about the album? Do you want to buy tickets or merch? Or do you want to read a review? An AI search engine will have to reimagine all these things, which I never had to think about. 
- The UX is a mystery and the only way to discover it is by typing. And typing. And typing. Anil gives the example of Zork. `You pick up a rock.` `You move left.` In the OpenAI demo, the team member typed `search web history for a doc about atlas core design`. It goes back to Point 1, where the AI cannot recognise intent so it has to be clearly spelt out. Also, Anil points out that there is a high risk involved if you forget the correct set of magical incantations, because LLMs have a huge risk of hallunciating. 
- ChatGPT is very obviously hoovering up data. You are the customer. Warning labels are required because regular humans cannot be trusted to use the technology without self-harm. Agree.
