Conservatism is just political speak for humans natural inclination to dominate and feel superior than others.  Its very natural state is to ignore or cause the hurt in others for personal gain.  

The only time a conservative can be a good thing, is when people push to be superior off of merit and good character, and typically showing humility is still required.  Unfortunately for everyone else, its so much easier to be superior using bad behaviors than good ones.  Hence dictatorships, war and conflict exist in spades. Forcing others to be lower is a conservative cornerstone.  

Confederacy, Nazis, Most Monarchies, Oligarchies, Zionists, Religious fanatics… conservatism without morals, superiority attained without humility and empathy.
